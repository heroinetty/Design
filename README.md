# Design and Development of Online Judge System Based on Python & Vue
## Abstract
  Online Judge (OJ) was originally used in the automatic contest and ranking of ACM/ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contest and OI information Olympiad.Now,itiswidelyappliedtothetrainingofstudentsinallpartsoftheworld, training and selection of participants, various programming competitions, data structureandalgorithmlearning,andautomaticsubmissionofassignments.
  
  The paper will startwith therequirement analysis of OJ system, and then wewill discuss topics ranging from system architecture design, specific module development to issues and challenges we solved, including Web server development based on Python and Django, database and cache related performance optimization, complex single page application based on Vue, sandbox security mechanism based on Seccomp.
  
  Based on the above technology, a set of relatively complete and independent Online Judge system is implemented to support two competition modes ofACM and OI.
